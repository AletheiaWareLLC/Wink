# Wink

Wink is framework for developing Fault Tolerant Systems with Asynchronous Concurrent Independent Hierarchical Finite State Machine.

## Fault Tolerance

> A system is fault-tolerant if it continues working even if something is wrong.
>
> Fault-tolerance cannot be achieved using a single computer â€“ it may fail.
>
> -- *Joe Armstrong*

### Principles

1. Isolated Fault Units - split software into multiple small independent modules that run concurrently to achieve a single objective or fail fast.
2. Supervision Tree - modules can monitor the lifcycles of submodules.
3. Message Passing - modules communicate asynchronously.
4. Live Upgrade - modules can be updated without restarting the whole system.
5. Persistent Records - logs are written to storage that can survive reboot.

## State Machine

A State Machine;
- Runs Independently and Concurrently for Fault Isolation.
- Has a Lifecycle that is monitored by the Spawner.
- Communicates Asynchronously to minimize Latency and maximize Throughput.
- Can be Updated and Restarted without affecting others
- Writes logs to either stdout or the filesystem.
- Has a Hierarchy of States to minimize Code Duplication.
- Is Uniquely Identified by its Binary Name and Network Address;
  - local `:<port>` or `localhost:<port>` or `127.0.0.1:<port>`
  - remote `<ip>:<port>`

### States

Each State consists of a unique Name, an optional Parent, an optional Entry Action, an optional Exit Action, and a set of Receivers.

### Actions

An action is triggered when a state is entered or exited.

### Receivers

A receiver is triggered upon receipt of a matching message.

The optional empty receiver is triggered if no other receivers match.

### Example

```
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

#include <Wink/address.h>
#include <Wink/log.h>
#include <Wink/machine.h>
#include <Wink/state.h>

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
  if (argc < 3) {
    error() << "Incorrect parameters, expected <spawner> <address>\n"
            << std::flush;
    return -1;
  }

  Address spawner(argv[1]);
  Address address(argv[2]);
  UDPSocket socket;
  Machine m(spawner, address, "switch/Switch", socket);

  m.AddState(std::make_unique<State>(
      // State Name
      "off",
      // Parent State
      "",
      // On Entry Action
      []() { info() << "Switch is OFF\n"
                    << std::flush; },
      // On Exit Action
      []() {},
      // Receivers
      std::map<const std::string, Receiver>{
          {"on", [&](const Address &sender,
                     std::istream &args) { m.GotoState("on"); }},
          {"off", [&](const Address &sender,
                      std::istream &args) { m.GotoState("off"); }},
      }));

  m.AddState(std::make_unique<State>(
      // State Name
      "on",
      // Parent State
      "off",
      // On Entry Action
      []() { info() << "Switch is ON\n"
                    << std::flush; },
      // On Exit Action
      []() {},
      // Receivers
      std::map<const std::string, Receiver>{}));

  m.Start();
}
```

## Lifecycle

When a State Machine spawns another, the parent receives lifecycle messages from the child.

In the "success" case, the parent will receive;

- started - the child indicates it has started and provides the parent with the name of its binary and the address (ip:port) it has bound to.
- pulsed - the child indicates it is still alive by sending a heartbeat message every 2 seconds.
- exited - the child indicates it has terminated.

In the "error" case, the parent will receive;

- started - same as above.
- pulsed - same as above.
- errored - the child indicates it has encountered an error by sending the error message to the parent.
- exited - same as above.

If a parent doesn't receive a heartbeat for 10 seconds it will assume the child has failed (maybe the computer crashed, lost power, or the network disconnected - who knows?!).

When a parent is notified that a child has errored, it can chose to do nothing, restart the child, or raise an error. In the last situation, the grandparent will be notified that the parent has errored.

  }

  UDPSocket socket;
  Machine m(spawner, address, "family/Parent", socket);

      // State Name
      "main",
      // Parent State
      "",
      // On Entry Action
      [&]() {
        info() << "Parent: OnEntry\n" << std::flush;
        m.Spawn("family/Child");
      },
      // On Exit Action
      []() { info() << "Parent: OnExit\n"
                    << std::flush; },
